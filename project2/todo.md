To Do's Project 2
---

###	after speaking with TA
*	The point of this is a benchmark. Setup a rel. difference with 
	beta produced, cehck for 
	*	Epochs
	*	minibatches
	*	learningrate 
	*	learningschedule
	Then move on

### project description
1   writing SGD code, first step:
*   scikitlearn solutions for 
	*	~~ols~~
	*	ridge 
*   ~~implement mse, r2 etc. for SGD~~
*   analyse performance SGD as func of
    *   learningrate
    *   number of minibatches
    *   number of epochs
    *   algo for scaling learningrate
*   compare with scikitlearn SGD methods
*   for Ridge, study as func of 
    *   learningrate and hyperparameter
*   discuss results


#misc
*	Need to add containment on properties in gradient descent
