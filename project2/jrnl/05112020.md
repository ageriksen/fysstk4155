trying to finish out SGD test wrt. franke system regression
---

I need to implement a comparisson between the SGD and
the skl coefficients of predictions. Use the assumption
that scikitliearn is correct and compare the results as such.
The comparison should probably be done wrt. 
*	Epochs
*	minibatches
*	learningrate 
*	learningschedule

So today, 
implement k-fold CV to test
implement setting learningrate/learningschedule
implement loops over minibatches, epochs, learningrate
test for all, find a way to store the necessary info.
