Implementing a much simpler example to compare and contrast ols and GD
---

Mainly based on the methods at the end of lctnotes week 39 for a simple case
of a polynomial.

The base implementation is more or less finished. The GD produces mostly similar
results to the ols as well as the skl version.

Next would either be to visualize the simple case, implement the SGD in the GD class.
Or going straight for the franke implementation.
