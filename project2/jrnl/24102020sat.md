Stochastic GD code 1st step
---

According to the project text, replace OLS and Ridge matrix inversion 
methods from project1 with SGD

Analyse the results, for OLS and Ridge as a function of learningrates,
\# of minibatches and epochs as well as the algorithm for scaling the 
learningrate. Could also compare results from skl.
