Working On Implementing Sklearn OLS And Error Analysis
---
I think I've implemented the ols fit and predict properly.
found some errors with the R2 score for the results. Need to 
look at the definition.

OK. So it seems the issue was with the definition. The score
function took the (X, y) input, rather than what I thought 
intuitively. I havent tested if the results of the test makes
sense, but it should be fine. 

I now have the R2 and MSE for both skl and SGD versions, 
MSE for both train and test sets and I plot the results. 
The results DO NOT follow expectations of bias-variance for
the model complexity on the train/test relationships. 

Not sure why, have posted a question in piazza.
