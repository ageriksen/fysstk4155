Working on implementing Gradient Descent
---

There are several places going through the methods here,
*	lecture notes week 39, 40, 41
*	Aurelion Geron'S "Hands-On Machine Learning With 
	scikit-Learn & Tensorflow" ch. 4, p. 149/760 in mupdf
*	Kevin p. Murphy's "Machine Learning A Probabilistic
	Perspective" sections 8.3 and 8.4(I believe), p. 245 
	and on, or 276/1098 in mupdf.

I've marked the pages in mupdf, let's see if these are saved between instances. 
I'm currently on week 39, with the steepest descent part for the lecture notes.
