work on testing implementation of skl methods for 2a
---

So I've implemented the OLS skl methods and I can now take the
scores I've gotten from them and plot them. I can't quite verify
the results, though since they seem to be more erratic than I'd 
expect and also do not show quite the same bias-variance tradeoff 
I'd expect.
