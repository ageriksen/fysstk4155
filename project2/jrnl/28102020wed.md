damagecontrol?

I don't have the code to really easily compute and compare
the SGD methods to the regression for project 1.
A solution might be to not implement all, maybe just 
ols and ridge for sgd and compare it to skl methods which
have inbuilt methods to find good estimates. Then I can 
compare the SGD version to them.

so...To Do:
1   writing SGD code, first step:
*   scikitlearn solutions for ridge and ols
*   implement mse, r2 etc. for SGD 
*   analyse performance SGD as func of
    *   learningrate
    *   number of minibatches
    *   number of epochs
    *   algo for scaling learningrate
*   compare with scikitlearn SGD methods
*   for Ridge, study as func of 
    *   learningrate and hyperparameter
*   discuss results
