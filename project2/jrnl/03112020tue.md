Regression with skl
---

I've set up the program to function with skl for
OLS with no resampling. The results are fishy, but
the program runs. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but
the plots of MSE do not show the bias-variance tradeoff
as one would expect.

I think maybe  I'll try to implement some resampling and 
hyperparameters.
