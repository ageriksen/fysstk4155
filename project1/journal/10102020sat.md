This is the final day of the project, I've more or less gotten nowhere. 
---
I still need to implement ridge regression, which for some reason hits the issue that the design matrix 
bombs when I try to create it. Don't know why.

I don't really have the time to make it work, because the deadline is so close. I should probably write 
the report now, but I've only really got...3/4 plots of stages in the project, not even the actual terrain
data.  So best case, it'd be a report on all the things I didn't do. not particularly enticing.
