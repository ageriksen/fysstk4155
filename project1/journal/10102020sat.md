This is the final day of the project, I've more or less gotten nowhere. 
---
I still need to implement ridge regression, which for some reason hits the issue that the design matrix 
bombs when I try to create it. Don't know why.

I don't really have the time to make it work, because the deadline is so close. I should probably write 
the report now, but I've only really got...3/4 plots of stages in the project, not even the actual terrain
data.  So best case, it'd be a report on all the things I didn't do. not particularly enticing.


###I got an extension. 
Looking back on the code for the ridge regression, I copied the previous code over below and commented out
any particulars for the hyperparameter and reintroduced it step by step. Now I got the correct feature matrix. 
But something was wrong with the Ridge method. I couldn't se anything wrong with it, so I rewrote it, using X and
y rather than feature matrix and target. I think I had forgotten a transpose at the end, which might have been the culprit. 
It seems to work now
