Make Bias-Variance plot of OLS franke regression
------------------------------------------------
with 
`MSE(y_tilde) 	= mean(y - mean(y_tilde)) + mean( y_tilde - mean(y_tilde)) + sigma^2` 
`				= BIAS + Variance + sigma^2`
we can study the interplay of bias and variance with increasing model complexity

Got sidetracked - working on object-orienting script
----------------------------------------------------
I've made most of the current script into function objects. Further, it might be easier
to make it a class, but that would be another step down. 

currently, I have a main function, one for generating data, one for running the OLS 
over the desired amount of polynomial degrees. 

still need to add the printouts and/or saving of the results.
