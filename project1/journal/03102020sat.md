asking help by mail/piazza regarding confidence intervals in beta
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I asked for help.
turns out i didn't have a sigma^2=1, and therefore didn't scale things
properly. 

so  I added it. 
it works now

when terrain data comes into the picture, the test MSE could be used.
