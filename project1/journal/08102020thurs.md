k-fold Cross Validation OLS
---
implementing the k-fold CV, so
full data:
```
 ---------------------
|train/validation|test|
 ---------------------
```
split the train/val set into k equal folds
```
 --------------------
|	|	|	|	|	 |
 --------------------
```
Then select 1 to be the validation and use the rest
to train the model. Cycle through the k folds and 
estimate the accuracy of the different models. 
save the test set as an independent data set to 
control/verify results. 

Did the thing. I still need to scale properly. And the parameters aren't tuned
and I still need to compare the mse's between this and bootstrap. 
Also, sklearn version.
